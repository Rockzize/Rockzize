## Hi there 👋

I'm Gastón a game developer and programmer from Argentina.

I'm currently working as a game designer and programmer with two artists in a videogame called Dice Or Death.

It's a 3D dice tabletop videogame about a group of heroes exploring a dungeon and fighting monsters within it with unique sets of dice.

The game is being developed in Unity.
